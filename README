Predict
=======

I noticed a lot of chess players who prepare themselves for the Belgian Interteam Competition.
They download the results of previous rounds, create a table and look up the games of the possible opponents.

This script does the hard work, by downloading the results, parsing the html pages, and preparing the tables.


Usage:
------

python predict_nic.py -c <club number>

Warning:
--------
It's not idiot proof.



have fun,

Romain.
